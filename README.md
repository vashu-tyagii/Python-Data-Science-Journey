# Python-Data-Science-Journey

Welcome to my personal, open-source repository dedicated to mastering Python for Data Science and Machine Learning!

---

## Overview

This repository is a structured collection of my practical implementations, projects, and learning exercises. It progresses from core Python fundamentals to specialized topics in data science, machine learning, and deep learning. Each section contains hands-on code and examples to solidify understanding.

This resource is designed to serve as both a personal learning log and a public reference for anyone navigating the world of Python for data science.

## Repository Contents

The project is organized into logical modules, covering the essential skills required for a data science professional:

### **1. Python Fundamentals Core Concepts**

- **Python Basics**: An introduction to Python's fundamental syntax, data types (numbers, strings, booleans), variables, operators, and control flow (if/else, for loops, while loops).

- **Python Functions**: Learn how to define and use functions to organize and reuse code. Topics include function arguments, return values, and scope.

- **Python Data Structures**: A deep dive into Python's built-in data structures: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries. Learn their characteristics and how to use them effectively.

- **Python OOPs Concepts**: An introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This section covers classes, objects, methods, attributes, and key OOP principles like inheritance and polymorphism.

- **Python Exception Handling**: Learn how to write robust code by handling errors gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks.

- **File Handling**: Understand how to interact with files on your system. This includes reading from, writing to, and managing text and binary files.

- **Python Database Handling**: An introduction to connecting to and interacting with databases from Python. This typically covers using libraries like sqlite3 for basic database operations.

### **2. Data Manipulation & Analysis**

- **NumPy**: Fundamental library for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **Pandas**: Powerful library for data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.

### **3. Data Visualization**

- **Matplotlib**: A comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Seaborn**: A high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

### **4. Machine Learning**

- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**: Explanations and implementations of core machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- **Scikit-learn**: Hands-on examples of using the most popular library for machine learning in Python.

### **5. Deep Learning**

- **Keras**: High-level API for building and training deep learning models.
- **PyTorch**: An open-source machine learning framework for building deep neural networks.
- **TensorFlow**: An end-to-end open-source platform for machine learning.

## Getting Started

To explore and run the code in this repository, you **must** ensure a clean, reproducible environment. This project was developed and tested against **Python 3.11.9**.

### **Mandatory Setup Steps**

1.  **Check Python Version:**
    The required version is specified in the **`.python-version`** file. If you use a version manager like `pyenv`, it will automatically select the correct interpreter when you navigate to this directory. If not, ensure you install **Python 3.11.9** first.

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/vashu-tyagii/Python-Data-Science-Journey.git](https://github.com/vashu-tyagii/Python-Data-Science-Journey.git)
    ```
3.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Python-Data-Science-Journey
    ```
4.  **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (`venv`):**
    **Do not** use your global Python installation. This step isolates project dependencies.
    ```bash
    # 4a. Create the virtual environment using the correct Python version
    python -m venv venv

    # 4b. Activate the environment (Command varies by OS/Shell)
    # On Windows (PowerShell):
    .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    # On macOS/Linux (Bash/Zsh):
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
5.  **Install Dependencies from `requirements.txt`:**
    The `requirements.txt` file contains the exact, pinned package versions. This is the only way to guarantee the code runs as intended.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
6.  **Environment Verification (Recommended):**
    Confirm that the correct packages are installed within the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip list
    ```
7.  Explore the directories and run the Python scripts to see the implementations in action.
